title: My first Jekyll blog post
---

This is actually my _second_ post. The first one was when I'd set up this website, and had written it in plain HTML. I set up this jekyll blog to post approx. day to day updates regarding my [GSoC project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5621295143190528) with [Open Chemistry](http://www.openchemistry.org/).

This blog has been set up by forking https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now
